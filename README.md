# Vue Dijkstra - Find the Cheapest Path Between Airports

Vue Dijkstra - Airport Pathfinder is a web application developed as part of the Data Structure II course at [UNIDAVI](https://www.unidavi.edu.br/). This project is built with [Vue3](https://vuejs.org/) and [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/), and it utilizes Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the most cost-effective path between Brazilian airports.

## Features

- **Interactive Map**: Visualize the calculated path on an interactive map powered by Leaflet, making it easy to understand the recommended itinerary.
- **Cost Estimation**: Get an estimated cost for your journey based on available flight options and their associated prices.
- **Optimized Paths**: Discover the most economical routes, minimizing both travel time and expenses within Brazil using Dijkstra's Algorithm.

## Technologies and Libraries Used
- **Vue3**: This entire project is developed using Vue3, providing a smooth and responsive user experience.
- **Leaflet**: Leaflet is the leading open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps. In this project is used to create interactive maps that display the calculated flight path and airport locations.
